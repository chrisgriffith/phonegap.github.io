Building applications for each platform–iPhone, Android, Windows and more–requires different frameworks and languages. PhoneGap solves this by using standards-based web technologies to bridge web applications and mobile devices. Since PhoneGap apps are standards compliant, they’re future-proofed to work with browsers as they evolve. Read an in-depth post [explaining PhoneGap visually](http://phonegap.com/blog/2012/05/02/phonegap-explained-visually/).

PhoneGap has been downloaded millions of times and is being used by hundreds of thousands of developers. Thousands of apps built using PhoneGap are available in mobile app stores and directories. Check out some of them [here](/apps).

The PhoneGap code was contributed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under the name [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) and graduated to top-level project status in October 2012. Through the ASF, future PhoneGap development will ensure open stewardship of the project. It will always remain free and open source under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Nitobi was the original creator and is one of the primary contributors to the PhoneGap framework. In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi enabling the team to focus solely on the PhoneGap project and continue its work on efficient development across mobile platforms.

There is also vast global community that contributes to the project. We have an active community that is open and collaborative. Check out a [list of committers to the project](https://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#cordova) and [learn more about contributing](http://cordova.apache.org/contribute/). We want your help!
