<h2>Hot App: TaxiMe for iPhone and iPod Touch</h2>
<p><a href="http://taxime.ca/blog/iphone/"><img src="http://www.bootandblade.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/taxime.png" alt="TaxiMe" width="225" height="339" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" /></a>Ever wonder how much that taxi ride will set you back? This month's hot PhoneGap app is <a href="http://taxime.ca/">TaxiMe</a>. It estimates the cost of your cab ride in Canada and the US using the most up-to-date cab rates.
</p>
<p>TaxiMe uses built-in GPS to locate your current location and calculate the distance to your destination. You can search by business name if you don't know the destination address, and can access cab contact info directly from the app.</p>
<p>If TaxiMe doesn't have the rate for your home town, it queries your state or province and uses the rate of the closest city to you. Check out this <a href="http://taxime.ca/blog/supported-cities/">complete list</a> of supported cities.
</p>
<p>TaxiMe available in <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/taxime/id370102517?mt=8">the App Store</a> for $0.99.</p>

<p>Please keep submitting your PhoneGap apps to the directory using <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/nitobi.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dGp6U0Q1ekJmRVlndlE0UUFIMzFfbmc6MA">this form</a> for your chance to be featured in a PhoneGap newsletter.</p>

<h2>Resources from PhoneGap Training Webinars</h2>
<p><img src="http://nitobi.com/images/pg_training_logo.png" alt="PhoneGap training" width="225" height="113" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" />Thanks to all of you who joined us for training webinars last month. We hope you're now writing your own PhoneGap apps.</p>

<p>For those who couldn't make it, we're sharing some useful resources from the webinar that will enhance your PhoneGap development:
<ol>
<li><b>XUI</b>: A mobile-optimized, PhoneGap-friendly JavaScript framework. jQuery inspired but lightweight. XUI is also compatible with various legacy browsers on some mobile platforms such as Symbian and BlackBerry. For the source: <a href="http://www.github.com/xui/xui">http://www.github.com/xui/xui</a>. For builds, run the "build" script in the root directory. If you want to build a version for blackberry, run "build profile=bb".<br><br></li>

<li><b>Lawnchair</b>: A lightweight client-side JSON-based document store. Can leverage different offline storage mechanisms, some of which are inherently present on most mobile platforms supported in PhoneGap (i.e. iPhone, Android, Palm). Source: <a href="http://www.github.com/brianleroux/lawnchair">http://www.github.com/brianleroux/lawnchair</a><br><br></li>

<li><b>GloveBox</b>: A JavaScript library to help with building mobile-friendly scrolling containers in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Source: <a href="http://www.github.com/purplecabbage/GloveBox">http://www.github.com/purplecabbage/GloveBox</a></li></ol></p>

<h2>Mashable Gives PhoneGap the Thumbs Up</h2>
<p>We were stoked to see PhoneGap included in Mashable's piece, <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/11/cross-platform-mobile-development-tools/">5 Cross-Platform Mobile Development Tools You Should Try</a>.</p>
<p>Writer Jolie O'Dell urges readers to check out PhoneGap and some other tools as an "excellent alternative to ignoring one mobile OS in favor of another, or perhaps worse, burning serious resources to develop for two or three platforms at once."</p>
<p>Even cooler than PhoneGap getting a thumbs-up from Mashable is seeing growing attention and support for cross-platform development.</p>

<h2>Where in the World is PhoneGap?</h2>
<p>We'll be hanging out at various conferences over the next couple of months and would love to meet up with you. Here's where to find us:</p>
